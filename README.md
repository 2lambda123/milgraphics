Military Tactical Graphics

So I got some ideas about making military tactical graphics other than point symbols. I will tro to develop them here.

## Main idea

The main idea is to create the following, this might expand later on. 

### Input

GeoJSON with SIDC etc. stored as properties. (A specification for how to store geometries as GeoJSON will be created.)

### Output

Points will be points with style information for different libraries (Cesium/OpenLayers etc.)

Lines will be lines, might have style information about simple label placement.

Polygons will be polygons, might have style information about simple label placement.

Other geometries (arrows and stuff) will be converted to lines or polygons so that they can be displayed on a map and make sense.

The over all main idea is to keep it simple from the begining and then move forward where it is needed.

## Feedback

Please add issues for feedback and ideas
